# Primer — Next Session Brief

**Audience:** future Claude Code session continuing work on this repo.
**Last updated:** 2026-11-05 14:23 (UTC).

**One PR is open against `main`** from this session:

| PR | Branch | What | Closes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **#397** | `fix/kb-seed-edits-392` | Seed top-up replaces a passage edited under the same id; `primer-kb-load/src/lib.rs` split (this brief rides on it) | #392 |

- **`main` is at `8c6f3cf`** (#396).

**Since the last brief:** #396 merged; #393 is CLOSED.

## What we shipped this session

### #397 — `79500be` (fix), `caf4a3c` (split), `2322926` (docs) + this brief's commit: closes #392
- **Approach:** no schema bump and no content hash. The cache already stores each passage's text, so the seed write compares `(source, text)` with the stored row directly.
- **primer-knowledge:**
  - `insert_seed_new` is now a sync and returns `(inserted, replaced)`. Inside its `IMMEDIATE` tx it reads `id → (rowid, source, text)` (`stored_passages_in`); unchanged rows skip, changed rows are deleted (`delete_passage_inner`: FTS5 `'delete'` with the old values, then the content row, whose vector cascades) and re-inserted.
  - `LocaleSql` gained `delete_fts` + `delete_content`.
  - New `pub fn stored_passages() -> HashMap<id, (source, text)>`; **`list_passage_ids` was removed** (its only caller was the loader).
- **primer-kb-load:**
  - `write_seed` sends only new-or-changed passages (first occurrence of an id wins); with none it writes nothing, as before.
  - `LoadStats` gained `replaced`; the binary prints it.
  - The `shortcut:` comment in `prepare_kb` is gone. The embed step refills the dropped vectors with no extra code.
  - **Behaviour change:** `load_jsonl` (the standalone binary) also replaces edited passages now; the module doc says the JSONL is the source of truth for its ids. Those rows lose their vector until a `--reembed`.
- **Split (behaviour-preserving):** `lib.rs` 560 → 272; `discover.rs` (98) holds seed discovery, `prepare.rs` (209) holds `reembed_kb*` / `auto_seed_if_empty` / `prepare_kb`. `pub use` keeps every path; `cargo test -p primer-kb-load` is 168 before and after.
- **Tests** (both mutation-checked: skip-instead-of-replace, and content-only delete leaving the FTS row):
  - `primer-knowledge::insert_seed_new_replaces_a_passage_whose_text_changed`: FTS forgets the old text, only the edited passage lacks a vector;
  - `primer-kb-load::prepare_kb_top_up_replaces_an_edited_seed_passage`: two JSONL versions through `prepare_kb`; `(inserted, replaced, skipped) = (0, 1, 1)`, one re-embed.
- **Docs:** CLAUDE.md (the `primer-knowledge` seed-loading sentence, the `LocaleSql` diagnostics list, the `primer-kb-load` bullet + split note); README (the `load_jsonl` sentence). ROADMAP: no change (bug fix + refactor).

### Gate
- `cargo test --workspace`: 1482/0.
- clippy `-D warnings`: workspace `--all-targets`; `primer-kb-load --features fastembed`.
- fmt; workspace rustdoc (+ `primer-kb-load`/`primer-knowledge` `--document-private-items`).
- fastembed: `off_topic_gate`, `retrieval_quality_hybrid`, `retrieval_quality_hybrid_de` all green.
- **Not run:** the GUI `speech` / `android-native` clippy arms and the feature rustdoc arms (no code under those features was touched).

> SHAs are branch-tip commits as pushed; squash-merge gives new ones on `main`.

### Per-session sweep
- **Inline-test detector:** clean for the twenty-fourth session running.
- **Oversized list:** `primer-kb-load/src/lib.rs` is off it (272). The production files still over 500: `primer-cli/src/main.rs` 1422, `primer-speech/src/macos/tts.rs` 668, `primer-inference/src/qnn/genie/real.rs` 566, `state_machine/inner.rs` 506, `primer-speech/src/macos/stt.rs` 504. The rest are test files.

## What's next (concrete acceptance criteria)

### 0. Owner review/merge: #397
- **Acceptance:** CI green and merged; then `gh issue view 392 --json state` shows CLOSED.
- **Optional owner check:** edit one passage's `text` in `data/seed/seed_passages.en.jsonl` (keep its `id`), start the CLI with the default embedder, and look for `replaced=1` in the `loaded JSONL into knowledge base` log line plus one passage re-embedded. Revert the edit after; the next start replaces it back.

### 1. Sweep + inline-test detector: re-run EVERY session
Commands are in the resume block.

### 2. Manual first-run GUI check for #396 (owner)
Still not watched in the real webview: `mv ~/.primer/kb ~/.primer/kb.bak`, launch the GUI, Start new → Save & start; the button should count "… 0 / 91" upward. Resume on a cold cache shows the same line in the picker.

### 3. Other bugs (host-completable; TDD each)
- **#371** (voice-loop abort on stop timeout) needs a `JoinHandle::abort` design note first.
- **#352 remaining:** item 2 needs the owner decision below; items 1 and 4 need a design note before code.
- **Older:** #312, #315, #316, #325/#326, #362, #364, #365. Read each before choosing.

### 4. Production-code splits (owner-approved lane, all feature-gated, so dual-verify)
- **`primer-inference/src/qnn/genie/real.rs`** (566 lines, `qnn`) is the recommended one. Baselines: `cargo test -p primer-inference`; `cargo clippy -p primer-inference --features qnn --all-targets -- -D warnings`; the rustdoc `qnn` arm.
- **`primer-speech/src/macos/{tts.rs 668, stt.rs 504}`** (`macos-native`).
- **Low value:** `state_machine/inner.rs` (506). **Hardest:** `primer-cli/src/main.rs` (1422).

### Carried / owner-or-hardware-gated
- **#260:** Android-voice on-device acceptance; also re-check on device that a denied mic keeps the text session (#369).
- **#192:** manual macOS-native STT + injected TTS smoke.
- **#170 Stages B, E and F:** the OpenRAIL-M disclosure must ship before any default flip.
- **#166 item #1:** owner-run WhisperStream reuse smoke.
- **#135:** glib (blocked on Tauri 3).
- **Branch protection:** make `cargo test (default features)` a required check.
- **Other:** QNN token stability, NPU tuning, latency-routing calibration.

## Open decisions / risks

### This session (#397)
- **A passage *removed* from the seed corpus still stays in the cache.** Only edits and additions sync. Pruning ids absent from the corpus would be wrong for an explicit `load_jsonl` into a user DB holding several corpora, so it would need a cache-only flag. Filed as #398 (latent: no seed passage has ever been removed).
- **Every startup with a cache now reads every passage's text** (it read only ids before). Trivial at 91/66 passages; linear in corpus size.
- **Any whitespace change in a seed line's `text` counts as an edit** and costs one re-embed of that passage. Correct, just worth knowing when regenerating the wiki layer.
- **A replaced passage gets a new rowid.** Nothing keys on passage rowids outside the KB (vectors cascade), so this is harmless.
- **`load_jsonl` into a user-managed KB now rewrites edited rows** and leaves them without a vector until `primer-kb-load --reembed`; hybrid retrieval treats them as BM25-only meanwhile (#389).

### From #396 (merged)
- **Manual first-run GUI check not run** (item 2 above). Progress is one event per 16-passage batch (~18 s apart on BGE-M3); the restart button's long text may wrap on a narrow modal; voice-mode rebuilds report nothing; the CLI prints only its one-line notice.

### #352 item 2: what counts as a pointless fallback? (owner decision, unchanged)
`--fallback-backend == --backend` with a different **model** is legitimate (small/big ollama models, or hybrid routing on one server).
- (a) notice only when kind **and** model match;
- (b) kind-only, worded as "no protection if the server goes down";
- (c) drop the item and keep the `tracing::warn!`.

**Recommendation:** (a), and downgrade or drop today's kind-only warn on the router path.

### From #394 (merged)
- **First-run cost is large:** ~106 s for BGE-M3 over 91 EN passages on an M-series Mac. The first `--language de` run pays again for its 66 passages. Weaker hardware will be slower. Android stays `--embedder-backend none` (#157), so no cache is built there.
- **The cache is per machine and per model, and holds no child data.** It is created with `create_private_dir_all` anyway. Deleting `~/.primer/kb/` is safe: it rebuilds on the next open.
- **An explicit `--knowledge-db` that was never re-embedded is still BM25-only with `min_score = 0.0` on the hybrid path.** That is the (b) half of #388, not done. Only the stopword filter (#386) defends it.
- **An embed failure at startup is a `warn!` only** (CLI stderr and GUI `gui.log`). The session runs BM25 plus #389 hits and retries on the next open.
- **Model-slug collisions:** `slug()` lowercases, so model ids "BGE-M3" and "bge-m3" share a file. The second model then finds no missing passages, and its vector leg is empty (a `warn!`, BM25 fallback). This is rare: both names would have to be configured on one machine.
- **#389 hits use `KB_BM25_ONLY_MIN_SCORE`, not `HybridParams.min_score`** (that one is an RRF floor and meaningless for BM25 scores).
- **The GUI now builds the embedder before opening the stores.** A locale-mismatch error therefore surfaces only after the (seconds-long) fastembed load.

### Carried from earlier sessions
- **#390 (stopwords):**
  - **The lists are hand-built.** Every added word must not appear in a real child question. Re-run `retrieval_quality{,_de}` + `off_topic_bm25` + `bm25_floor_tripwire`.
  - **BM25 margin narrowed:** min top-K 0.80 and worst top-1 1.12, against the 0.5 floor.
  - **Hindi has no list.**
- **#387 (off-topic gate):**
  - **Recall margin is thin:** 0.023 below the lowest benchmark query ("was ist schall", 0.473). An on-topic question just under 0.45 gets **no** grounding (now possibly some, via #389, on a partly embedded KB).
  - **Only `bge-m3` is gated**, and the gate depends on the model id string.
  - **`HybridParams` is shared with LTM**, which ignores `min_top_cosine`.
- **#385:** a resume right after a turn can block for up to the background budget (10 s worst case).
- **#384:** `finish()` only recovers a complete-but-unterminated final unit.
- **#381:** a `force` reembed clears the locale's vectors up front. A model still used by another locale stays pinned at its old dim.
- **#382:** a *write* failure in a later seed file still leaves earlier files committed (`shortcut:` in `load_seed_files`).
- **#374:** a corrupt `embedding_models` row is a hard retrieval error (intended).
- **#369 residual:** a session-build failure after the close still loses the text session (`shortcut:` in `start.rs`).
- **#370:** v9 drop/rename runs with `foreign_keys = ON`.
- **Mislabelled rows from before #363** keep the wrong id (#352 item 4).
- **#360 permissions:** existing `0644` DB files are protected only by the `0700` parent; Windows and Android are untouched.
- **GUI logging:** rotation only at startup; the log may hold child text.
- **Notice text is English-only** and operator-facing.
- **Stale CMake cache after Xcode/SDK upgrades:**
  1. `find src/target -name CMakeCache.txt -maxdepth 6 | xargs grep -l 'MacOSX<old>'`
  2. `cargo clean -p <those sys crates>`
- **The `github` MCP server fails to connect** (bad Authorization header). The `gh` CLI works.
- **zsh gotchas:**
  - `$var` is not word-split; use `${=spec}`.
  - **Quote `echo '==='`**; an unquoted `===` errors with "== not found".
  - Use `git grep … -- '*.rs'`.
- **Cargo stops at the first failing test crate.** `primer-knowledge` has no `fastembed` feature; use `-p primer-kb-load --features fastembed` for the fastembed arm.
- **A foreground `cargo test --workspace` exceeds the 600 s tool timeout** when something slow sneaks in. Run it with `run_in_background` and grep the log.

## Patterns to reuse, not reinvent

- **Syncing derived rows against a source of truth (new):** before adding a hash column + schema bump, check whether the stored row already holds what you would hash. #392 compared stored `(source, text)` directly. Deleting from an external-content FTS5 table needs the old values: `INSERT INTO t(t, rowid, …) VALUES('delete', rowid, …)` (`LocaleSql::delete_fts`).
- **Splitting a lib.rs by byte offsets (new):** slice the file at two unique doc-comment anchors in Python, write the pieces to new files with their own `use` lines, add `mod x; pub use x::*;`, then `cargo build` to find the stale imports. Compare test counts with `git stash -u` / `stash pop`.
- **Progress from a long Rust step to the webview (new):** pass `&mut (dyn FnMut(..) + Send)` down the call chain (it keeps the Tauri command future `Send`). The command closes over `&AppHandle<R>` and calls `app.emit(CONST, payload)`. Test it with `tauri::test::mock_app()` + `app.listen(CONST, ..)`, then call the generic command with `app.handle().clone(), app.state()`. Rust listeners fire synchronously, so assert straight after the `await`.
- **Smoke-running the real CLI without touching the owner's home (new):** make a scratch `HOME`, symlink `~/Library/Caches/primer` into `$HOME/Library/Caches/primer` (so BGE-M3 isn't re-downloaded: `dirs::cache_dir` follows `$HOME`), and set `PRIMER_SEED_DIR=/Users/hherb/src/primer/data/seed`. A directly-run binary has no `CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR`, so without it seed discovery finds nothing. Grep `RUST_LOG=primer=info,primer_kb_load=info,primer::retrieval=debug` for `ready` / `reembedding` / `gate`.
- **GUI tests must not use the default embedder (new):** `GuiConfig::default()` picks fastembed on a default build, and since #394 a session build then embeds the whole corpus (~100 s per test). Set `cfg.embedder.kind = "none"` in any test config that builds a session, or use a `StubEmbedder` when the KB is under test (`stage_tests.rs::knowledge_base_with_embedder_*`). A `primer-gui` test run over ~10 s is the symptom.
- **Old-behaviour baseline for the stopword filter (new):** open a KB under `Locale::Hindi` (empty list) and `load_jsonl` the EN seed files into it. That gives the pre-#386 ranking side by side with the filtered one in a single probe run.
- **Before/after sweep numbers (new):** `git stash -u` → run the `#[ignore]`'d sweep → `git stash pop`. To see which `KNOWN_FAILING_*` entries now pass, empty the list temporarily (perl), run `retrieval_quality`, then restore from a scratchpad backup.
- **Per-token blame for a leaky query (new):** run each token alone through `kb.retrieve` at the production params. #386's probe showed the very common words ("is", "the", "can") were already under the 0.5 floor, and the leaks came from mid-frequency function words plus content words.
- **Calibrating a retrieval threshold (new):** measure the distribution *before* designing the fix. A throwaway `tests/zz_probe.rs` that embeds every seed passage (read the JSONL, skip `#` comment lines) and prints per-query best cosine + BM25 hit counts answered #307 in one run. The committed version is `off_topic_gate.rs::off_topic_gate_probe`. When the distributions overlap, report the numbers and let the owner pick the trade-off.
- **Struct-literal field additions across the workspace (new):** `git grep -n "HybridParams {"` to list them. A regex keyed on `min_score: …,\n source_filter` also hits `RetrievalParams` literals, so check each match.
- **Driving a real streaming backend end to end (new):** `crate::test_http::serve_once(body)` in `primer-inference` answers one request with `200` + `body` and then closes, with no `Content-Length`. Point `OllamaBackend::new` / `OpenAiCompatBackend::new` / `CloudBackend::new` at the returned URL, then `crate::test_http::collect(stream)`. Use it for any spawn-loop behaviour (EOF, mid-stream error payloads) that buffer-level tests can't reach.
- **Restructuring a big match arm without retyping it (new):** a Python regex that captures the existing blocks and reassembles them, then `cargo fmt`, then verify with `git diff -w` that only the intended lines changed. Assert exactly one match before writing.
- **JS behaviour without a JS runner:** use an `include_str!` contract test in `primer-gui/src/*_contract.rs`. Slice the function body by a unique anchor string and assert the call is there. See `voice_stop_contract.rs` and `diagnostics_toggle_contract.rs`. Mutation-check by stashing the `ui/` changes and re-running.
- **Cross-file JS hooks:** app.js exports `window.primer*` functions at the bottom; voice.js lists the ones it uses in its header comment. Add new hooks in both places.
- **Migration tests:** pin *behaviour* (cascade fires, UNIQUE rejects), not DDL text. Build `fresh_vN_conn()` by chaining the earlier helpers. Fixtures should call the real `apply_vN_migrations`; never hand-roll the DDL.
- **Effective backend:** use `primer_engine::served_identity(...)` everywhere. Never re-derive it from `config.backend.kind`.
- **End-to-end degraded-primary GUI tests:** pair a `qnn` primary with a `cloud` fallback and an Inline key (`primary_unavailable_cloud_fallback_config()`).
- **Misbehaving-embedder tests:** wrap `StubEmbedder` and alter its output (`DropsLastEmbedder` in `primer-kb-load/src/tests.rs`). `Named` lives at `primer_core::speech::Named`.
- **Corrupt-row DB tests:** register a row, then `UPDATE … SET <int col> = 'not-a-number'` to force a read-side type error (`conn_with_corrupt_dim`).
- **Forcing a mid-transaction write failure:** open a second `Connection` on the same temp file and add `CREATE TRIGGER … BEFORE INSERT … WHEN NEW.id = 'bad' BEGIN SELECT RAISE(ABORT, 'x'); END`, or `DROP` the FTS table. See `insert_passages_rolls_back_*` in `primer-knowledge/src/tests.rs`.
- **Mutation-check a transaction:** remove the transaction entirely. Writing through `&conn` while a `BEGIN` is still open on the same connection is NOT a valid mutant: those writes are still inside the transaction.
- **DM background-task tests:** `await_pending_background()` is `pub(super)` and reachable from `dialogue_manager/tests/*`. Call it directly to force "what the next turn would apply" without scripting a second turn.
- **Env-var-dependent code:** inject `impl Fn(&str) -> Option<String>`; never use `set_var`. For seed discovery, test `load_seed_files(kb, &paths)` directly instead of setting `PRIMER_SEED_DIR`.
- **Mutation-check new tests:**
  1. Back up the file to the scratchpad.
  2. Apply the mutation with `perl -0pi`.
  3. Run the filtered tests.
  4. Restore the file.
- **Python `sub()` edits:** a helper that asserts the match count stops before the write.
- **Bug-fix recipe:**
  1. Branch off `origin/main`, and check `git branch --show-current` **before** editing. This session again started #314 on the previous fix's branch, and had to `git stash` → `checkout main` → `checkout -b` → `stash pop` before committing.
  2. Failing test, then fix, then green.
  3. Test + clippy each touched crate, plus its feature arms. Then fmt and rustdoc.
  4. `git grep` the docs for drift.
  5. Commit with `Closes #N`, push, open the PR.
  6. File any out-of-scope half as an issue.
- **Split recipe, substantive-line diff, Dependabot triage:** see `docs/handoffs/2026-10-16T202752Z.md`.
- **Driving a real `#[tauri::command]` in a test:** make it generic over `R: tauri::Runtime`, then call it with `tauri::test::mock_app()` + `app.manage(AppState::new(..))` + `app.state()`. See `commands/voice/tests.rs::app_with_text_session`. A command taking only `tauri::State` needs no generic.
- **Migration that changes an existing FK:** follow v9 (`pragma_foreign_key_list` guard + a create / copy / drop / rename tx).
- **Session start:** check `git status` first, and read `NEXT_SESSION.md` AFTER `git pull`.

## Reporting back

- **#397:** when we correct or update an encyclopedia passage that ships with the Primer, installs that already have the library now pick up the corrected text on their next start (and re-index just that passage), instead of keeping the old version forever. Closes #392. The loader's main file was also split into smaller pieces, with no change in behaviour.
