"""HTTP retry helper for the data-ingestion pipeline.

Adds 429/5xx retry-with-exponential-backoff around an injected
``http_client.get`` call. The helper is HTTP-shaped (status-code
dispatch + ``Retry-After`` header) and lives separately from the
Rust ``primer_core::retry`` (which is ``InferenceError``-shaped).

Pure helpers — ``is_retryable_status``, ``parse_retry_after``,
``compute_delay`` — carry no I/O and are easy to unit-test
exhaustively. The composing function ``retry_http_get`` accepts
``sleep`` and ``jitter_fn`` as kwargs so tests inject deterministic
no-op equivalents.

Out of scope here: network-error retry, HTTP-date ``Retry-After``,
failed-batch persistence. See
``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-09-fetch-leads-backoff-design.md``.
